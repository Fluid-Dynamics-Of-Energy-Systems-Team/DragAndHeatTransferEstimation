## Estimate skin friction and heat transfer for compressible turbulent boundary layers

This repository contains the source codes to estimate mean profiles and fluxes in high-speed turbulent
boundary layers using inner/outer-layer transformations. The codes are based on the [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02199.pdf) by Asif Hasan, Johan Larsson, Sergio Pirozzoli, and Rene Pecnik. 




They source code can be used in the following ways:

  - Execute the jupyter-notebook in [Google's colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Choose 'GitHub' and copy the link of the repository: https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation/blob/master/DragAndHeatEstimate.ipynb. Use shift+enter to run cells.


  - Render the jupyter-notebook in [github](https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation/blob/master/DragAndHeatEstimate.ipynb).


  - Download the plain python in the directory 'python'.
