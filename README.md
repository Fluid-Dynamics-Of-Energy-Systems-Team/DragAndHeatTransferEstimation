## Estimate skin friction and heat transfer for compressible turbulent boundary layers

This repository contains the source codes to estimate mean profiles and fluxes in high-speed turbulent
boundary layers using inner/outer-layer transformations. The codes are based on the [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02199.pdf) by Asif Hasan, Johan Larsson, Sergio Pirozzoli, and Rene Pecnik. 




They source code can be used in the following ways:

 - Render the jupyter-notebook in [github](https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation/blob/master/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation.ipynb)
 - Execute the jupyter-notebook in [binder (might take some time to start)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation/main?filepath=DragAndHeatTransferEstimation.ipynb). To execute the notebook online, it is necessary to install a few modules (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas). This might take some time as well. After installation, you can remove the !pip install commands at the beginning of section "Iterative solver". 
  - Download the plain python code [DragAndHeatTransferEstimation.py](https://github.com/Fluid-Dynamics-Of-Energy-Systems-Team/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation/blob/master/DragAndHeatTransferEstimation.py)
